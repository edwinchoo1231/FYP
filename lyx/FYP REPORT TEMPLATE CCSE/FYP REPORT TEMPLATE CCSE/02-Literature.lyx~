Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, the case study of the operational model of ride-sharing
 and bike-sharing application are discussed thoroughly.
 The existing system of the application is studied and discussed further
 especially on features, limitations, advantages and disadvantages throughout
 this chapter.

Ride Sharing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Public transportation plays a significant role in daily lives of Malaysian
 citizens as it connects each other to the desired destination.
 Some of the most common form of public transportation such as bus, train,
 taxi and others, where one of the mode has occupancy lesser than 40% which
 is taxi in the form of vehicle.
 One of the reasons is that the service and cost of hiring a taxi is not
 proportional as customer feel there is unfairness in it 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "1"

\end_inset

.
 Monopolized and bad behavior of driver are also the reason for the low
 using rate of taxi.
 As compared to the other transportation, taxi carries the highest mobility
 and flexibility, with no tracks needed as compared to trains, and wider
 roads for busses, it is simply the best mode of transportation for short
 distance around a certain area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But since the occupancy rate of taxi is low, and special infrastructure
 needed for trains and bus, families with higher purchasing power can afford
 to buy a vehicle for daily travelling purpose.
 With that the cars on the road increases gradually which leads to high
 traffic on daily commute.
 Cars are not fully utilize if it carries only one passenger, and leads
 to the main reason for creating traffic jam commuting from one place to
 another.
 This can be solved by pairing users together with the same destination
 up to the maximum capacity of the car, the traffic condition could be reduced
 at least 4 times as compared to the worst case scenario mentioned earlier.
 But how do people solve that by knowing who is the exact person that has
 the same destination with the departing location within a close range?
 Analyzing the field of software development integrating with social media,
 this is made possible when information is shared on a platform which is
 to be viewed publicly, and user with high similarity will be known and
 paired which makes up to solving the case earlier.
 Crowdsourcing the data would automates the whole process and reduce the
 effort in exploring potential user in the domain of traffic and transportation

These sharing economy business is built not only on the technology advancement,
 but also in a sense of “trust” among each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The sharing of object among strangers solely rely on trust, is the key
 of success to the service provided, and it can be provided with a little
 help from technology.
 Building of platform ease the communication among each other.
 Tracking of whereabouts and usage rate can be monitored and viewed, in
 order to prevent unwanted events to happen.
 User will not be easily affected by words and saying from another user,
 and instead it will be affected by mainly the service provider’s performance
 and reputation

Bike Sharing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the operational concept of the Android application of MyCOMS is roughly
 similar to bike sharing system, the case studies done by researchers will
 be discussed in this section to further differentiates the difference comparing
 to ride-sharing application.
 According to Shaheen, bike sharing system is currently one of the transportatio
n system in major cities, in solving congestion problem, as well as the
 ‘last mile problem’ which can be further defined as the distance between
 home and the transit station, which can be too far to walk 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "5"

\end_inset

.
 Most of the big cities are using bike sharing as the solution for users
 in commuting between places where transit station is not available.
 Ricci has stated that bike sharing has a network of bicycles which spread
 across an area of strategically positioned ‘bike sharing station’, which
 can be used by user for point-to-point journey purpose in a period of time
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the reference made, the similarities is shown between bike sharing
 and MyCOMS application, where both of the application involves deployment
 of vehicles at stations, and allow users to book and use it for a period
 of time, for point-to-point travel purposes.
 However the downside of both application is that the vehicles would require
 rebalancing every day, as the demand will differs according to the factors
 based on the stations.
 The demand will fluctuate based on several aspect such as the weather,
 time of travel, location of station, population of station and etc., where
 every element plays important role in affecting the usage level of the
 application.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to rebalance the vehicle deployment, example and reference are
 taken from bike sharing model.
 Several research were done in predicting the demand as rebalancing of vehicles
 is always an issue for the service provider, with various method used.
 To avoid wastage of manpower in providing mobility in allocating the cars
 at the desired location, artificial intelligence system is adapted into
 the system.
 According to Syed, their study in forecasting bike demand using fuzzy interfere
nce mechanism has proved that the un-optimized fuzzy interference system
 can outperform un-optimized traditional feed forward neural network, and
 concludes that simple fuzzy interference based prediction is sufficient
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "7"

\end_inset

.
 Author also uses input parameters such as weather, holidays and number
 of user.
 Randomize of input is first done, and the system is run 5 times to ensure
 that the data obtain is accurate and consistent.
 This paper shows that the prediction using fuzzy logic is feasible, and
 is not limited only to using neural network for forecasting purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than that, user’s trip can be predicted as well according to the research
 which based on the fuzzy logic based trip generation model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 The prediction on user’s trip is important as it affect the demand level
 of each station in a whole.
 A notification can be sent to user as an alert of vehicle availability
 if the prediction data matched with the real-time data.
 A similar research on the user’s journey prediction is done as well 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 train predict.
 It predicts the passenger flow on journey from station to station.
 From it the traffic management can be done effectively as it helps in providing
 mobility to the vehicle in reaching stations which have high demand.
 This paper models the flow with fuzzy logic, adding features of passenger
 demand to the mode of transportation

With the high number of bicycle in a network of bike sharing system, a group
 of researcher did simulation optimization, to make sure that resources
 of bike sharing are shared and used equally 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "11"

\end_inset

.
 A proper data retrieved from the network can be mined and analyzed for
 future transportation improvements 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "12"

\end_inset

.
 Collaboration between modes of transportation will improve the strength
 and weakness of each other, which brings more benefits to the users.
 However comparing on the artificial intelligence method that are involved
 in prediction, several researchers have use different method such as planning
 algorithm and searching algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "13,14"

\end_inset

.
 Fuzzy logic will be used for this application as the data and number of
 input which the system has to deal with, is not complicated compared to
 the large network node in bike sharing system.
 Simple system for daily prediction require several input is suffice.

\begin_layout Section
COMS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
COMS is a single seated electric vehicle that is designed and manufactured
 by Toyota.
 According to the specification obtained from Toyota Auto Body Japan’s Corporate
 Social Responsibility Report 2013, COMS is a fully electric powered vehicle,
 that uses lead battery which can supply mileage of 50km per charge.
 COMS is able to run at a maximum speed of 60km per hour, and it has noises
 which is generated at below 71dB at acceleration, and even lower at 65dB
 when it is constantly running 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "15"

\end_inset

.
 It is targeted to serve user that would like to make short trip easier
 and more convenient.
 COMS has been deployed in several region of Japan, aiming to reduce carbon
 emission, as well as navigating through the narrow roads in most area of
 Japan.
 Its performance has won itself a Nikkei MJ Outstanding Award, which further
 strengthens its identity among community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Researchers have used COMS in various field, which ranges from entertainment
 field to safety autonomous featured ride on the road.
 A virtual reality (VR
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "VR"
description "Virtual Reality"

\end_inset

) system is modeled based on motion car, which in this case COMS was used
 as the platform 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "16"

\end_inset

.
 The COMS was deployed as a motion platform, where it provides simulated
 motion sensation to the VR user with autonomous driving.
 User will control the car with VR controller and headset, where vision
 through the headset will feel the motion when the car is synchronized.
 It is mentioned that COMS is used as it is easy to control and modify,
 which allow the developer to create more enhancement on the vehicle with
 the application of the technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another group of researchers have tried to utilize communication between
 vehicles by programming the vehicles to undergo platooning among each other
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "17"

\end_inset

.
 By having platooning and communication established among COMS, it is effective
 to notify users on availability, and enhance security features as the vehicles
 can communicate with each other.
 Safe distance are maintained with this features installed, data can be
 retrieved for analysis on the driver’s driving behavior.
 With the autonomous driving system developed from the past, this feature
 can be installed on COMS to provide more mobility around the campus 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "18"

\end_inset

.
 Single-seated MyCOMS has a limitation where it will have limited access
 when it is being driven to location which is not populated.
 The vehicle is not able to be used by people from other station, if there
 is no one to drive it from a remote station.
 The deployment of vehicle every morning can be scheduled automatically
 with autonomous driving, in arranging starting location of MyCOMS at a
 more strategic location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The battery level can be monitored and tracked as previous researcher has
 done the research in tracking and managing the electric demand and usage
 for electric vehicle 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "19"

\end_inset

.
 With this feature the battery level can be monitored and even predicted
 daily, in order for the vehicle to function properly throughout the day
 without having issue of user is stuck in the middle of the journey due
 to low battery level.
 A total number of trips can be counted and predicted in advance based on
 the daily real-time data, and is then charged to prevent the stated issue
 to happen.

\begin_layout Standard
oBike originates from Singapore, provides the security features between
 user and the bicycle, by having the user to scan QR code via the oBike
 app or enter the bike ID found on the bike.
 The application also allow bike booking, and is reserved under the user’s
 name for at most 10 mins.
 The sign up process requires phone number, and requires the user to allow
 permission on location so that nearest oBike can be found on the map via
 the oBike app.
 Payment can be done via Credit and Debit cards, and more payment option
 will be available later.
 It also has the Bluetooth technology to allow the users in locating the
 bicycle for a higher accuracy, and to identify the bicycle if there is
 a lot of them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
MoBike
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mobike that originates from China, has a lot similarities in terms of applicatio
n as compared to oBike.
 The difference between these two companies is that the location of deployment
 is different, and the infrastructure of the bicycle is different as well.
 The application allow user to book for 15 minutes, and is able to view
 the final location of bicycle when the trip is ended.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As outlined in the previous section, there are several application that

\end_inset

 location identifying can be adapted into MyCOMS application.
 The overall architecture of the developing structure of Android is explained
 and outlined to have more insight on the functionalities of the components.
 Several studies on the ride sharing and bike sharing system is done, and
 is relatable to MyCOMS application as it requires sharing of vehicles and
 time of usage optimized between desired users.
 Therefore, a hybrid version of ride-sharing which is MyCOMS application
 is needed in order to tackle the targeted vehicle, and improve the overall
 deliveries to the users.
