A website for admin should be developed in the future to ease admin in managing
 multiple usersâ€™ account with ease.
 With good design and layout, the website would reduce the trouble for admin
 to search through the database to look for certain details.
 The application for the vehicle can be developed and synchronized so that
 the details of the vehicles such as battery level, speed and location will
 be automatically updated to the database.
