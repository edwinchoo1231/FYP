LITERATURE REVIEW

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, the case study of the operational model of ride-sharing
 and bike-sharing application will be discussed thoroughly.
 The existing system of the application is studied and discussed further
 especially on features, limitations, advantages and disadvantages throughout
 this chapter.

Ride Sharing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Public transportation plays a significant role in daily lives of Malaysian
 citizens as it connects each other to the desired destination.
 Some of the most common form of public transportation such as bus, train,
 taxi and others, where one of the mode has occupancy lesser than 40% which
 is taxi in the form of vehicle.
 One of the reasons is that the service and cost of hiring a taxi is not
 proportional as customer feel there is unfairness in it

.
 Monopolized and bad behavior of driver are also the reason for the low
 using rate of taxi.
 As compared to the other transportation, taxi carries the highest mobility
 and flexibility, with no tracks needed as compared to trains, and wider
 roads for busses, it is simply the best mode of transportation for short
 distance around a certain area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But since the occupancy rate of taxi is low, and special infrastructure
 needed for trains and bus, families with higher purchasing power can afford
 to buy a vehicle for daily travelling purpose.
 With that the cars on the road increases gradually which leads to high
 traffic on daily commute.
 Cars are not fully utilize if it carries only one passenger, and leads
 to the main reason for creating traffic jam commuting from one place to
 another.
 This can be solved by pairing users together with the same destination
 up to the maximum capacity of the car, the traffic condition could be reduced
 at least 4 times as compared to the worst case scenario mentioned earlier.
 But how do people solve that by knowing who is the exact person that has
 the same destination with the departing location within a close range?
 Analyzing the field of software development integrating with social media,
 this is made possible when information is shared on a platform which is
 to be viewed publicly, and user with high similarity will be known and
 paired which makes up to solving the case earlier.
 Crowdsourcing the data would automates the whole process and reduce the
 effort in exploring potential user in the domain of traffic and transportation

These sharing economy business is built not only on the technology advancement,
 but also in a sense of “trust” among each other

.
 The sharing of object among strangers solely rely on trust, is the key
 of success to the service provided, and it can be provided with a little
 help from technology.
 Building of platform ease the communication among each other.
 Tracking of whereabouts and usage rate can be monitored and viewed, in
 order to prevent unwanted events to happen.
 User will not be easily affected by words and saying from another user,
 and instead it will be affected by mainly the service provider’s performance
 and reputation

Google Map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Google has released the API, which is developed to allow interaction between
 google services with internet content into web or mobile application.
 It acts as a black box, in receiving input of user, and process it, and
 is able to return the query with a Street view scene.
 Researcher have use the combination of Google Maps together with GSM modem,
 in providing tracking and locating services of vehicle

.
 Usage of smartphone which has both of the function, will allow the tracking
 and locating vehicle for monitoring purpose more convenient.
 According to this paper, the vehicle fleet management system can be polished
 with the tracking using GPS
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 A software is created for the tracking purposes as data is retrieved from
 the real-time update of the system.
 The system can be even be more advance with the implantation of GPS system
 on a System-On-Chip, and built in into the vehicle

 The same tracking method is also applied in this project, and it is fully
 deployed to evaluate the system performance

Review of Similar Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
oBike
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
oBike originates from Singapore, provides the security features between
 user and the bicycle, by having the user to scan QR code via the oBike
 app or enter the bike ID found on the bike.
 The application also allow bike booking, and is reserved under the user’s
 name for at most 10 mins.
 The sign up process requires phone number, and requires the user to allow
 permission on location so that nearest oBike can be found on the map via
 the oBike app.
 Payment can be done via Credit and Debit cards, and more payment option
 will be available later.
 It also has the Bluetooth technology to allow the users in locating the
 bicycle for a higher accuracy, and to identify the bicycle if there is
 a lot of them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
MoBike
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mobike that originates from China, has a lot similarities in terms of applicatio
n as compared to oBike.
 The difference between these two companies is that the location of deployment
 is different, and the infrastructure of the bicycle is different as well.
 The application allow user to book for 15 minutes, and is able to view
 the final location of bicycle when the trip is ended.

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As outlined in the previous section, there are several application that
 can be referred to, and the features in it such as QR code scanning, Bluetooth
 location detecting and GPS location identifying can be adapted into MyCOMS
 application.
 The overall architecture of the developing structure of Android is explained
 and outlined to have more insight on the functionalities of the components.
 Several studies on the ride sharing and bike sharing system is done, and
 is relatable to MyCOMS application as it requires sharing of vehicles and
 time of usage optimized between desired users.
 Therefore, a hybrid version of ride-sharing which is MyCOMS application
 is needed in order to tackle the targeted vehicle, and improve the overall
 deliveries to the users.
